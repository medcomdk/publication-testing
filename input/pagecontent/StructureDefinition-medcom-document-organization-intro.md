### Scope and usage 

This profile describes the MedComDocumentOrganization. This profile is inherited from the [MedComCoreOrganization](https://medcomfhir.dk/ig/core/StructureDefinition-medcom-core-organization.html) 
The base expectations when describing an organisation in a Danish context is to include an identifier, in terms of a Sundhundsv√¶senets Organisations Register (SOR)-identifier and a name of the organization. These requirements are due to the IHE XDS metadata standard (authorInstitution attribute) which requires an identifier and a name.
